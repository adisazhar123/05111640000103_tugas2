In version 2.3 of Python, this module was overhauled for enhanced security. It now provides three new functions, NamedTemporaryFile(), m
kstemp(), and mkdtemp(), which should eliminate all remaining need to use the insecure mktemp() function. Temporary file names cre

Return a file-like object that can be used as a temporary storage area. The file is created using mkstemp(). It will be destroyed as
soon as it is closed (including an implicit close when the object is garbage collected). Under Unix, the directory entry for the file is removed immed
iately after the file is created. Other platforms do not support this; your code should not rely on a temporary file created using this func
tion having or not having a visible name in the file system.ated by this module no longer contain the process ID; instead a string of six random characters is used.
